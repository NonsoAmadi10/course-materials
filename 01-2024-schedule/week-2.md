# Week 2

This week, we'll be studying Bitcoin Transactions. We will also cover Authorization and Authentication.
In Bitcoin Transactions, we will cover the structure of a Bitcoin Transaction and explore locking and unlocking scripts in a Bitcoin Transaction.

## Prerequisites

* You are expected to have completed Keys and Addresses as well as Digital Signatures. Additionally, we hoped that you've learned Schnorr Signatures and TapTweaks. 

## Goals

At the end of the week, we hope that you will:

* Learn the Components of a Bitcoin Transaction
    * TXID
    * Transaction Data
    * Transaction Fee
    * Transaction Weight
    * UTXO
* Understand how to authorize a bitcoin transaction
* Understand how a transaction is authenticated
* Understand how to parse a Bitcoin Transaction
* Understand Standard Transaction Locking and Unlocking Scripts for Legacy Transactions (P2PKSH, P2SH)
* Understand Standard Transaction
    * Legacy Transactions (P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH)
    * Segwit V0 (P2WPKH, P2WSH)
    * Taproot (P2TR - Key path and Script path spends)
    * Tapscript
* Transaction Timelocks (nLocktime and nSequence)
* Understand the basics of Bitcoin Script language
* Learn fundamental concepts of Scripts
    * Opcodes
    * Input Scripts
    * Output Scripts
    * Script Execution Stack
* Explore Script Complexities
    * Simple Scripts
    * Scripts With Flow Control(Conditional Clauses)
    * Complex Scripts
* Learn about more types of Scripts
    * Scripted Multisignatures
    * Merklized Alternative Scrip Trees(MAST)
    * Scriptless Multisignatures and Threshold Signatures
    * Tapscript

## Exercises
1. Perform the stack evaluation of this Bitcoin script and indicate whether it will result in true or false:  hex: '010101029301038801027693010487'
2. Given the string 'Btrust Builders', whose bytes encoding is '427472757374204275696c64657273', which is our preimage, generate the redeem script in hex format for the given preimage. Note: redeem_script => OP_SHA256 <lock_hex> OP_EQUAL

3. Derive an address with from the above (2) redeemscript and construct a transaction that send Bitcoins to the address

4. Construct another transaction that spends from the above (3) transaction given that you have both locking and unlock scripts.

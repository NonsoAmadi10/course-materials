# Week 7

## Primary focus

This week, you will be assigned a group to work on a project. In the project, you will showcase your pre-existing skills, and combine them with your new bitcoin and lightning knowledge to build something really innovative as a team.

Once you've formulated your idea as a team, you are expected to create a detailed plan. The plan will contain a break down of tasks into smaller achievable goals which are specific and measurable. You're expected to indicate an MVP end goal where you would consider the project in a workable (alpha) state.&#x20;

We look forward to see what you will be building!&#x20;

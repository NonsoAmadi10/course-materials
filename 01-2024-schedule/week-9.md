# Week 9

This week, we will re-focus on Open Source Projects. Having contributed a few weeks ago, you are expected to identify an Open Source project or continue working on the earlier identified project working on more impactful issues. While contributing, you are expected to constantly provide us updates on the progress you are making on the issues you are working on.
